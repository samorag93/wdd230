                The Apple.com home page focuses on offering a simple and straightforward 
                experience. The top navigation bar contains only a small number of options, 
                and the main page displays images and a clear message related to organization 
                and what is important visually.This creates a direct visual and emotional 
                connection between the website and users.

                The application of Hick's Law in the design of the Wix website 
                is evident in the intuitive and simplified interface it offers 
                users for creating websites. Wix has taken a user-centered design 
                approach by providing tools and customization options, but at the 
                same time, organizing these options in a logical and accessible way.

                Google Search applies Fitts' Law effectively in its design, prioritizing 
                accessibility and efficiency in user interaction. The search field, which 
                is the main function of the page, is highlighted with a considerable size 
                and placed in the center of the home page. 
                Additionally, the search field has a click-sensitive area that spans the 
                entire length of the field.
